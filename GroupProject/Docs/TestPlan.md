#Test Plan
This is the template for your test plan. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.

##1 Testing Strategy
###1.1 Overall strategy

This section should provide details about your unit-, integration-, system-, and regression-testing strategies. In particular, it should discuss which activities you will perform as part of your testing process, and who will perform such activities.

We plan to use a combination of unit and system testing to verify the functionality of the product. The main class database util will have various methods pertaining to the interaction of the application with the database and hence unit testing will be performed on this file to verify functionality. Various other methods in the other classes like grocerylist manager, grocerylist and list item will have similar unit tests as well wherever possible.

We will try to keep code coverage high on all the code except the UI code and will test our UI on various size emulators in order to be certain that it is consistent across different device sizes.

We will use beta testers to check for UI usability and use that feedback for better user experience. 


###1.2 Test Selection
Here you should discuss how you are going to select your test cases, that is, which black-box and/or white-box techniques you will use. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.

We will use both black box and whitebox testing techniques. Black box testing will include getting help and feedback from various beta testers. Trying to add invalid input and trying to make the code execute unexpected values.
Using code reviews and bug finding sessions we will perform white-box testing and unit tests will also help us be certain that individual modules work as expected

###1.3 Adequacy Criterion
Define how you are going to assess the quality of your test cases. Typically, this involves some form of functional or structural coverage. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.
We will use code coverage tools to analyze our testing quality

###1.4 Bug Tracking
Describe how bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked.
Github will be used to keep track of the bugs we will let users open issues that can be monitored by the entire team

###1.5 Technology
Describe any testing technology you intend to use or build (e.g., JUnit, Selenium).
We will use JUNIT to perform our unit tests

##2 Test Cases
This section should be the core of this document. You should provide a table of test cases, one per row. For each test case, the table should provide its purpose, the steps necessary to perform the test, the expected result, the actual result (to be filled later), pass/fail information (to be filled later), and any additional information you think is relevant.

| Purpose                                                                 | Steps Performed                                                                             | Expected Result                                                                         | Actual Result | Status(P/F) |
