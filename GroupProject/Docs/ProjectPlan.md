# Project Plan - Team 16

**Author**: Anshul Goel, Dwight Nelson, Shu Xu, Zakariya Ahmad

## 1 Introduction

This document describes the software development process (CS6300) for Team 16  of the Fall 2016. The project is for a custom android application that manages grocery lists and items that the user wants to buy at a grocery store. 

## 2 Process Description

The grocery list manager will be implemented using the Rational Unified Process (RUP) which will consist of multiple phases, modifications, aspects and implementations throughout this software development process. Documents, design, codes and methods are generated as part of this process. 

*Review the requirement for software design* (done)
	*Activity description: In this activity, the team review the requirement from the customer and discuss the details of potential classes and use case for the design.
	*Entrance criteria: The detailed requirement from the customer.
	*Exit criteria: A blue print of the UML diagram is drafted and the flow of the use cases has been schemed.

*Design software architecture via UML diagram* (done)
	*Activity description: After the discussion about the details for the development, the team design UML diagram for software development, including the use cases, the interface and future implementation considerations.
	*Entrance criteria: the requirement from the customer and blue print of the UML diagram from each member.
	*Exit criteria: A well-designed UML diagram for software development.

*Plan Use Case Model *
	*Activity description: In this activity, the team member will draft use cases of the software.  A set of possible sequences of interactions between systems and users is listed out.
	*Entrance criteria: UML diagram designed.
	*Exit criteria: the possible sequences of interactions are identified and the USE CASE documentation is finished.

*Plan unit test case*
	*Activity description: The plan for testing the architectural prototype of the grocery manager application. A Test Plan document supports this activity, including identification of the test target project information and the softwareList , the recommendation of test requirements (high level), the testing strategies, and the required resources.
	*Entrance criteria: UML diagram designed.
	*Exit criteria: the key test cases are identified and a test case documentation is finished

## 3 Team
Our team consists of four team members. Every member will be in charge of one specific aspect of each phase and also participate in peer review process of each deliverable. Weekly meeting and instant messages are delivered via google hangout and slack. The documents are reviewed through google docs and GitHub, and codes are share via GitHub.

*Describe the team and their roles (there may be more roles than there are team members)*
