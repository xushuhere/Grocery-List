# Project Plan - Team 16

**Author**: Anshul Goel, Dwight Nelson, Shu Xu, Zakariya Ahmad

## 1 Introduction

This document describes the software development process (CS6300) for Team 16  of the Fall 2016. The project is for a custom android application that manages grocery lists and items that the user wants to buy at a grocery store. 

## 2 Process Description

The grocery list manager will be implemented using the Rational Uniffied Process (RUP) which will consist of multiple phases, modifications, aspects and implementations throughout this software development process. Documents, design, codes and methods are generated as part of this process.

## 3 Team
Our team consists of four team members. Every member will be in charge of one specific aspect of each phase and also participate in peer review process of each deliverable. Weekly meeting and instant messages are delivered via google hangout and slack. The documents are reviewed through google docs and GitHub, and codes are share via GitHub.

*Describe the team and their roles (there may be more roles than there are team members)*
