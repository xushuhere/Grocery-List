# Project Plan 
**Author**: <Team 16> **Anshul Goel, Dwight Nelson, Shu Xu, and Zakariya Ahmad**

## 1 Introduction

This document describes the software development process (CS6300) for Team 16  of the Fall 2016. The project is for a custom android application that manages grocery lists and items that the user wants to buy at a grocery store. 

## 2 Process Description

The grocery list manager will be implemented using the Rational Unified Process (RUP) which will consist of multiple phases, modifications, aspects and implementations throughout this software development process. Documents, design, codes and methods are generated as part of this process. 

##### *Review the requirement for software design* (done, D1) 
* *Activity description: In this activity, the team review the requirement from the customer and discuss the details of potential classes and use case for the design.*
* *Entrance criteria: The detailed requirement from the customer.*
* *Exit criteria: A blue print of the UML diagram is drafted and the flow of the use cases has been schemed.*

#####  *Design software architecture via UML diagram* (done, D1) 
* *Activity description: After the discussion about the details for the development, the team design UML diagram for software development, including the use cases, the interface and future implementation considerations, and database relational analysis.*
* *Entrance criteria: the requirement from the customer and blue print of the UML diagram from each member.*
* *Exit criteria: A well-designed UML diagram for software development and database relational analysis.*

##### *Plan Use Case Model*
* *Activity description: In this activity, the team member will draft use cases of the software.  A set of possible sequences of interactions between systems and users is listed out.*
* *Entrance criteria: UML diagram designed.*
* *Exit criteria: the possible sequences of interactions are identified and the USE CASE documentation is finished.*


##### *Plan unit test case*
* *Activity description: The plan for testing the architectural prototype of the grocery manager application. A Test Plan document supports this activity, including identification of the test target project information and the softwareList , the recommendation of test requirements (high level), the testing strategies, and the required resources.*
* *Entrance criteria: UML diagram designed.*
* *Exit criteria: the key test cases are identified and a test case documentation is finished.*

##### *Design database schema*
* *Activity description: this activity is mainly involving the design of database through SQL for the management of item database in the grocery list application.*
* *Entrance criteria: UML diagram designed and the database relational analysis finished.*
* *Exit criteria: database schema is finished and SQL create table is completed.*

##### *Implement the computation method*
* *Activity description: this activity is mainly involving from an original design use case and test case for this application to executable java program.*
* *Entrance criteria: UML diagram designed, use case, database design, and test plan.*
* *Exit criteria: the main functions of the application is finished with reasonable outputs, very few bugs, and maintainability.*

##### *Develop Prototype*
* *Activity description: Determine basic requirements including the input and output information desired, user interfaces, examine the prototype inside the team and provide feedback on additions or changes.*
* *Entrance criteria: UML design and main use cases are provided.*
* *Exit criteria: Revise and Enhance the Prototype.*

##### *Revise and complete use case model*
* *Activity description: based on the prototyping, the requirements and specifications for the software development.*
* *Entrance criteria: prototype is developed.*
* *Exit criteria: an updated use case model documentation is finished.*


##### *Develop and implement database schema*
* *Activity description: based on the prototype and use case model, the team will design the specific database and implement basic SQL tables and SQL queries for the software development.*
* *Entrance criteria: use case model is completed.*
* *Exit criteria: database SQL table and queries.*

##### *Develop use case model and unit test*
* *Activity description: based on the prototype and use case model, the team will develop the basic use case and implement basic unit tests.*
* *Entrance criteria: use case model and unit test model are completed.*
* *Exit criteria: main case use are developed and most unit tests are performed.*


##### *Review the Alpha release of software*
* *Activity description : the team will review the initial version of the application.*
* *The system should be working for the main action and the functional requirements are met.*
* *Entrance criteria: use case model and unit test model are developed.*
* *Exit criteria: a functional application is released.*


##### *Document system testing case model*
* *Activity description: the application will be tested on different devices/systems. The results will be documented.*
* *Entrance criteria: Alpha release of the software*
* *Exit criteria: the testing results are documented and the software meets most of requirements.*


##### *Fix system test issues*
* *Activity description: After the system testing, the bugs from system testing will be fixed and expected behavior /artifact are as expected.*
* *Entrance criteria: system testing*
* *Exit criteria:system bugs are fixed.*
##### *Review and test Beta release*
* *Activity description: the team will review the modified version of the application. The system should be working with most assessment, the main action and the functional requirements are met. Multi-iterative step review to test the behavior of the software.*
* *Entrance criteria: system bugs are fixed after alpha release*
* *Exit criteria: the systemâ€™s expectation and actual behavior are the same.*

##### *Review all deliverables*
* *Activity description: the team will meet and review the software and make sure every documentation is updated. Beta release testing bugs are fixed.*
* *Entrance criteria: beta release*
* *Exit criteria: all documents are in place and the system is functioning as expected.*

##### *Commit and release final application*
* *Activity description: the application is released to GitHub and a final commit id will be submitted to T-square.*
* *Entrance criteria: the review all deliverables*
* *Exit criteria: finish the project.*


## 3 Team
Our team consists of four team members. Every member will be in charge of several specific aspects of the projects and also participate in peer review process of each deliverable. Weekly meeting and instant messaging are delivered via google hangout and slack. The documents are reviewed through google docs and GitHub, and codes are share via GitHub.


### Anshul Goel
Anshul will be the lead for the following deliverables and artifacts:
- *Graphic design of the software*
- *Test plan documents and diagrams*



### Dwight Nelson
Dwight will be the lead for the following deliverables and artifacts:
- *User interface design*
- *Software architect design*

### Shu Xu
Shu will be the lead for the following deliverables and artifacts:
- *Database implementation*
- *System testing and implementation*
- *Implement supplementary requirements*


### Zakariya Ahmad
Zakariya will be the lead for the following deliverables and artifacts:
