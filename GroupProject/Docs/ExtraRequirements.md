## 2 Extra Requirement Description

### Feedback system
- The software should provide meaningful and helpful feedback in the case of misuse. A sever will be built to receive the error messages with the permission of users. These error messages allow the user to more easily debug the program.

### Additional Skin and Themes
- Additional Skin and Themes for the UI design will also be provided to alter the view of the software.

### Portability to Different Devices
- The software is designed for android cell phone uses, but the probability to certain tablet devices should be also implemented.
- Design decisions should keep a possible future port to iOS in mind. 

### Robustness of operation
- Robustness will be the extra requirement to handle unexpected termination and unexpected actions. Exceptional cases of the design and test will help ease terminations.

### Maintainability of the software
- Maintainability of the software will be one of extra requirements to keep the system up and running after installation. Maintaining and cleaning the temporary files, properly terminating certain activities, and post-release updates are the approaches for a good maintainability. 

### Usability 
- User interface must be intuitive for usability purposes.
